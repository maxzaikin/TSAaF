    "Notice how the y-axis shows negative values. Does this mean that the earnings per share are negative? Clearly, that cannot be, since our dataset strictly has positive values. Therefore, we can say that the seasonal component shows how we deviate from the trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Residuals**\n",
    "is what cannot be explained by either the trend or the seasonal components. We can think of the residuals as adding the Trend and Seasonal graphs together and comparing the value at each point in time to the Observed graph. Residuals usually correspond to random errors, also termed white noise,They represent information that we cannot model or predict, since it is completely random\n",
